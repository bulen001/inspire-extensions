  <h1>The End-To-End Tutorial</h1>

  <p>After all the background and methodology, it's time to get our hands dirty. For this tutorial, we will use as many freely accessible tools (such as Open Source) as possible to make the material more accessible.  You will need the following software:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Data Modelling: <a href="http://www.sparxsystems.com.au/" target="_blank">Enterprise Architect</a></li>
    <li>Schema Transformation: <a href="http://shapechange.net/" target="_blank">ShapeChange (Open Source)</a></li>
    <li>Data Transformation: <a href="https://www.wetransform.to/products/halestudio/" target="_blank">hale studio (Open Source)</a></li>
    <li>Service Publishing:<a href="http://www.deegree.org/" target="_blank">deegree (Open Source)</a></li>
  </ol>

  <p>You also need a test data set to play around with. We're going to use an Open Data resource provided by the city of Hamburg.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>It's late on a rainy Friday afternoon. I am in the middle of reviewing an article when my boss Alex calls. He sounds agitated and tells me that there is a problem, so he needs me to help him. Ten minutes later, we sit together at the bar of the pub across the road. Alex tells me about the meeting he has had in the last two days in the capitol city, with many other directors of public authorities.
    </p>
    <p>
      After ordering our drinks, he starts to tell me what bothers him: &laquo;<em>We're being blamed for lack of progress on two projects. The ministry is under pressure from the EU, because of our lack of progress in INSPIRE implementation. In addition, after last year's new legal act, we're supposed to implement a new national building permit system, but we haven't made any headway on this one either. After the meeting yesterday, we at least have some funding for the national project, though there is almost no budget for INSPIRE. I need you to take over the building permit implementation project, while I will figure out how to fund the INSPIRE project.&raquo;</em> I listen to his explanations for a few more moments, then I interrupt him: &laquo;<em>You know what? Give me both your problem projects. I have an idea how we can make both work at the same time, with one budget! Do I have your support?&raquo;</em>
    </p>
    <p>Two weeks later, I've assembled my team. I've got three domain experts from spatial planning and cadastre, an integration expertIt was really hard to get some of them on board - everybody is tied up in their daily projects, and some were not exactly keen on INSPIRE. In our first meeting, we analyse relevant documents</p>
