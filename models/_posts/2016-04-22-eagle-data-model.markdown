This model was created to improve external processes (such as reporting) with other organisations. The EAGLE team, a group of European experts, mainly on Land Cover and Land Use, was contracted by EEA in order to create a new data model, database scheme, generalization methodologies, population & database for land cover data.

The EAGLE group was also involved in the INSPIRE TWG, so connectivity with the INSPIRE specifications is very high. Together with the extended data model they also generated example datasets (in ESRI and PostGIS format) according the EAGLE data model,  available on the Copernicus webpage. EAGLE results are property of European Environment Agency, but freely delivered at Copernicus web page.
