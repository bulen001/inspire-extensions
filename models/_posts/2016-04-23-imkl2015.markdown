IDgis designed this model to fulfill national and European legal obligations. The model will serve as a data specification for national data download service on INSPIRE (2016) and Dutch (2017) Network Utility information.
 
To combine national and INSPIRE models, we created types that inherit from both by mix-in. We used RDF SKOS for codelists; validation against these codelists to be developed.
