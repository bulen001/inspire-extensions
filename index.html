  <h2><a id="study_intro" class="anchor" href="#study_intro" aria-hidden="true"></a>The Study</h2>

  <p>In this project, we collect and document best practices for extending INSPIRE models. The resulting guidance will
    benefit organisations that want to use INSPIRE as a reference infrastructure. The documentation is centered on a
    <strong>pattern catalogue</strong> that describes common extension approaches and explains their impact on
    implementation. Through surveys and workshops, the INSPIRE community will be involved from the start on.
