        <h2>The Purpose of Patterns</h2>

        <p>In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. Design patterns are formalized best practices that the designers or programmers can use to solve common problems when building a system.</p>

        <p>Software design patterns falls into multiple categories such as structural and behavioural patterns. Structural pattern show relationships between classes that are static. In our extension design context, we define several new categories of design patterns. Based on the information given for each pattern, you will be able to make informed choice about how to design your model extension, and how to make it INSPIRE compatible.</p>

        <h3>Types of Patterns for INSPIRE Extensions</h3>

        <p>Model extension design as described in the <a href="/extension-methodology.html">extension methodology</a> is a hierarchical top-down process, where you first design a wide scope, and then drill down to make individual aspects concrete. We start at the level of the entire model, the proceed with adding classes, and then define these classes in detail by adding properties. For each of these phases, there are different patterns you can apply:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Patterns for adding classes and properties:</strong> These patterns describe how one or multiple classes are linked to classes in the INSPIRE data specification you'd like to extend. They describe which language features you use to implement them, and what consequences there are on a conceptual and implementation level.</li>
            <li><strong>Patterns for modifying properties:</strong> Property modification patterns describe how you can extend individual properties, e.g. by adding new constraints or by extending code lists. They also include consequences there are on a conceptual and implementation level.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>These patterns describe how one or multiple classes are linked to classes in the INSPIRE data specification you'd like to extend. They allow you to add new classes and also to add properties. The patterns describe which language features you use to implement them, and what consequences there are on a conceptual and implementation level.</p>

        <ul>
            {% for pattern in site.categories.patterns %}
                {% if pattern.patternType == "class" %}
                <li>
                    <a href="{{ pattern.url }}">{{ pattern.patternName }}</a>
                </li>
                {% endif %}
            {% endfor %}
        </ul>

        <h3><a class="anchor" name="propertyPatterns" href="#propertyPatterns" aria-hidden="true"></a>Patterns for modifying properties</h3>

        <p>Property extension patterns describe how you can modify individual properties, e.g. by adding new constraints or by extending code lists. They also include consequences there are on a conceptual and implementation level.</p>

        <ul>
            {% for pattern in site.categories.patterns %}
                {% if pattern.patternType == "property" %}
                <li>
                    <a href="{{ pattern.url }}">{{ pattern.patternName }}</a>
